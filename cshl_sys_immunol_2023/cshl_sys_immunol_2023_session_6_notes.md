## Spatiotemporal regulation of T cell activation niches—Integrating intravital multiphoton imaging with spatial and temporal scRNAseq

**Deborah Fowell, Cornell**

Lab is interested in spatiotemporal control of CD4 T cells and their function in response to infection

Think about how the activation event for CD4 T cells is optimized
- Need system to be both extremely sensitive and reversible, as well as precise and quick
- Many times, immune cells have to respond to weak signals in a noise environment
- Solution: generate inducible self-organizing structures

The organization of the lymph node and germinal centers is well established, but the structure of CD4 T cells in peripheral tissues is less well understood
- Have described peri-vascular activation niches

These types of peripheral peri-vascular activation niches occur both in inflammation in response to vaccine challenge as well as in cancers

Focus on Th1s - main producers of IFNg and TNFa in anti-microbial response
- Th1s express CXCR3, which binds CXCL9/CXCL10/CXCL11 on APCs

Peri-vascular niches are created by a chemokine hub, APC clustering, and defined by a T cell point of entry into tissue
- In the niche, T cells make prolonged contact with APCs
- Clustering of T cells in peri-vascular region prevents need for T cells to search for NPCs
- These type of niches may be important for cancer immunotherapy by providing an area sequestered away from the generally immunosuppresive region of the tumor

Study peri-vascular niches by integrating imaging with optagenetics and spatial transcriptomics
- Niches are identified using intravital multiphoton, then regions in and out of the niche are biopsied and assayed by scRNA-seq
- Murine model system of inflammation used to develop niches in accessible tissue (skin)

Niches have expanded population of neutrophils compared to non-niche and total tissue
- Also monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages along side T cells
- DGE reveals that niche-specific genes consist of chemokines (CXCL3, CXCL2, CCL4, CCL3)
  - Most expression derives from myeloid lineages
- CXCL10 is upregulated in the monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages, consistent with previous work
  - These cells also express Class II, so can both recruit and present to T cells

Performed CellChat analysis and identified most chemokine signaling (CCL) coming from myeloid cells, signaling to themselves and each other
- Looking at CXCL signaling, got weak results for T cells

T cells are enriched for genes related to T cell proliferation and cytokine activity
- Some markers of Th1 function for niche T cells, but not dramatically different from non-niche cells
- Conversely, signaling molecules are highly expressed (caveat: only selected genes shown, no scale bar so unable to tell if its simple z-scaling artifacts)
- T cells themselves produced many recruitment factors (CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL10, so on)

Went on to show that recruitment of CXCL10+ myeloid cells was independent of T cells (you get recruitment in a Rag-/- mouse)
- However, lack of T cells leads to loss of peri-vascular organization

CD4 T cells were able to enter into peri-vascular structures in the absence of CCR2 (main attractant from monocytes) but did not activate or produce IFNg - suggesting T cells need monocytes to form activation niche

Takeaway: T cell driven, monocyte-dependent niche assembly leads to highly organized peri-vascular immune structures to produce localized IFNg responses

Overall: Interesting talk and I wonder if we could identify these types of structures in the transplant setting (unlikely). Mouse perturbations are so strong (no T cells, no monocytes) that its hard to understand how these findings would apply to a human/NHP system.
