## Multi-Omic analysis identifies metabolic enhancement of immune memory by lysine deacetylase inhibition during immunisation and infection

**Eoin McKinney, Cambridge**

History of immunomodulation - "vaccine boosting"
- In 1926, Al2(SO4)3 - Aluminum sulfate was found to boost vaccine response by serendipity

Now - want to systematically evaluate immunomodulation to identify boosting adjuvants

Signature of experimental setup is T cell phenotype - does it develop a robust memory response or progressively proliferate and exhaust
- These two states are mutually polarized and transcriptionally distinct
- Use these profiles are template to identify compounds that can modulate between exhaustion and memory
- Previous work has shown that T cell exhaustion leads to better outcomes in autoimmune disorders; in other disorders it leads to worse outcomes

Compare gene signatures of immune cells to gene signatures from drug response libraries or disease studies
- Predict which drugs match best onto signature and are predicted to produce either a memory or exhausted phenotype
- Perform phenotypic screening on primary human CD8+ T cells and stimulate with polyclonal Ab, measure phenotype by PD1 (exhausted) vs IL7R (memory)
  - Allows for validation of _in silco_ predicted compounds
- Identified KDACi (lysince deacetylase inhibitor) compounds pushed CD8+ T cells towards memory state in reproducible manner
  - Only some KDACi had a strong effect, so studied differences between compounds to identify specific differences

KDACi induced glutaminolysis promote Tmem differentiation _in vivo_

Performed RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to understand changes being induced in T cells
- Identified DEGs and saw strong enrichment of entire memory signature
