## Modeling adaptive immunity using lymph nodes and microfluidics

**Rebecca Pompano, UVA**

Consider immune system from perspective of spatial organization
- Specifically, dyanmics - how do cells and molecules move and flow

Trying to predict immune function in complex settings (like post-vaccination)
- For example, vaccine challenge involves arm injection -> drains to lymph node -> APC to T cell interaction

Trying to use organiods and 3D cultures to give both experimental control while replicating complexity of _in vivo_ models
- Trying to both build organs (lymph node) on chip but also section tissue and keep alive _ex vivo_ allowing for better experimental control

Two experimental designs for exploring adaptive immunity
- Top down: lymph node explants
- Bottom up: microphysiological models
- Also developing assays that allow for spatially resolved readouts

Eventual goal: couple model of lymph nodes to models of other organs to eventually be able to predict multi-organ immune responses

Have created live ex-vivo lymph node slices
- Can label known cell types, can add drugs, allows for cell migration (T cells tend to reside in lymph node only for a day)
- Drawback - can't stain with markers that might activate lymph (so CD3...)
- Lymph node slices are capable of responding to ex vivo antigen challenges

Developing new version of assay to measure oxygen consumption (involves detector layer lying underneath slide)
- Showed data of T cell zones in lymph node slices taking ip O2 faster than B cell zones

Used microfluidic chips to assay local drug delivery to lymph node slices
- Use port to distribute drug to center of slice and observe changes if drug is directed at T cell zone vs B cell follicles
- Can also measure diffusion effects and model by using visual information (spread of stain after delivery)

Want to study responses to vaccination, built system to co-culture lymph node slices with cultures of other tissues (on chip) with shared media, allowing for crosstalk
- Cocultured lymph node slice with either healthy tissue or tumor (murine) for 24 hours, then remove lymph node from chip and stimulated with aCD3
  - Found that tumor co-culture suppressed secretion of IFNg in response to stimulus
- System can be used to mimic draining of immune cells in other tissue to lymph

Overall: Interesting work, but unclear how much results would translate out of this experimental system. Also mentioned lymph slices can be highly heterogenous depending on what gets included in slice
